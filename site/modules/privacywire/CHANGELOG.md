## 1.0.0a (alpha)
**Major Refactoring**. Rewritten both the JS and PHP parts.
- Added: Config option for output mode (regular script tag, ProCache script tag, inline script) 
- Added: Config option to choose elements which require consent by class `require-consent` instead of data-attribute (better performance). **WARNING**: Enabling this needs adding the css class `require-consent` to every element (also script tags!) you want to be processed by PrivacyWire
- Added: Config option to choose ES6 JavaScript instead of a _Babel_ transpiled version (Faster and smaller but no Internet Explorer support)
- Changed: Module methods refactored. Hookable methods changed. Take a look into [PrivacyWire.module](PrivacyWire.module) to see the difference
- Added: Possibility to manually refresh detection of elements (e.g. after loading content via AJAX). Just call `window.PrivacyWire.refresh();` after adding new content to the DOM which could require consent 
- Changed: Split markup from Banner and Consent Blueprint in two different files for better separation of concerns and easier hook management.
